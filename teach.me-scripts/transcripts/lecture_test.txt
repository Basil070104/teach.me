Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer III, for Fall 2024. In this course, we will explore the intricacies of the transport layer in computer networks. I'm your instructor, Vishal Shrivastav, and I look forward to guiding you through this fascinating topic as we delve into the core concepts and protocols.

TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. TCP uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with applications using a byte stream rather than packets. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.
