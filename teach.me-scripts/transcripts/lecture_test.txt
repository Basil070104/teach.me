Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer IV. In this course, we will dive into the intricacies of the transport layer, building upon the knowledge from previous courses. Our instructor for this semester is Vishal Shrivastav. Let's begin our exploration of this crucial layer in computer networking.

The Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. TCP uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with applications using a byte stream rather than packets. It is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.

TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery through application multiplexing, ACKs, retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. It uses byte stream abstraction, sending a stream of bytes rather than packets. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a sender-receiver connection and maintaining connection-specific state before transmitting data.

A TCP connection is identified by a 5-tuple of source and destination IPs, ports, and protocol. The connection setup exchanges an initial sequence number (ISN), used to mark the start of the byte stream. Each endpoint randomly chooses its own ISN to avoid overlap between connections.

Random ISNs prevent issues like port number reuse and TCP sequence number prediction attacks. If a connection's ISN was always 0, an attacker could easily guess valid sequence numbers. Randomizing the ISN makes it much harder for attackers to send counterfeit packets and hijack the connection.
