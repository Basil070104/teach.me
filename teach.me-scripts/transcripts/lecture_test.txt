Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer IV. In this course, we will dive into the intricacies of the transport layer, building upon the knowledge from previous courses. Our instructor for this semester is Vishal Shrivastav. Let's begin our exploration of this crucial layer in computer networking.

The Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. TCP uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with applications using a byte stream rather than packets. It is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.
