Today we'll review some basic 3D surfaces: lines, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Each is defined by a specific equation, as shown in the examples. Note the special case for the ellipse and hyperbola equations when the coefficients a and b are equal, resulting in a circle.

Cylinders are 3D shapes formed by extending a 2D curve into the third dimension. A "BLAH" 2D curve becomes a "BLAH cylinder" in 3D. Examples:
(a) Extending a circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1) in the z-direction forms a circular cylinder.
(b) Extending a cosine curve (z = cos(x)) in the y-direction forms a cosine cylinder.
