Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer IV. I'm Professor Vishal Shrivastav, and this fall semester, we'll dive into the intricacies of the transport layer in computer networks. This layer plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable, efficient data transport between hosts. Let's begin our exploration of this fascinating topic.

It uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with a byte stream rather than packets. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.
