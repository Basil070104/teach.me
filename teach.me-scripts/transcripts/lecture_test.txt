Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer IV. I'm Professor Vishal Shrivastav, and this fall semester, we'll dive into the intricacies of the transport layer in computer networks. This layer plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable, efficient data transport between hosts. Let's begin our exploration of this fascinating topic.

TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. It uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with a byte stream rather than packets. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.

TCP maintains connection-specific state like sequence numbers and window sizes to provide reliable, in-order delivery. The sender and receiver establish a connection before data transmission. This connection-oriented approach, combined with byte stream abstraction, allows TCP to deliver data to applications as an ordered stream of bytes.

A TCP connection is uniquely identified by a 5-tuple of source and destination IPs, ports, and protocol. The connection setup exchanges an initial sequence number (ISN), used to mark the start of the byte stream. Each endpoint randomly chooses its ISN to avoid overlap between connections.

Random ISNs prevent issues like port number reuse and TCP sequence number prediction attacks. If a connection's ISN was always 0, an attacker could easily guess valid sequence numbers. Randomizing the ISN makes it much harder for attackers to inject counterfeit packets into an existing TCP connection.
