This lab covers distributed routing protocols. You'll implement network routing and forwarding using routing tables. Routers forward data packets between source and destination nodes. You'll also do the Honors milestone, extending the Link State routing protocol. The source code will run in a simulated network environment.

This slide explains how to run the Python code for the lab. Use the provided JSON configuration files to specify the simulated network setup. Run the Distance Vector routing with "python3 network.py 01.json DV" and run the Link State routing for Honors milestone with "python3 network.py 01.json LS".
