Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer III, for Fall 2024. In this course, we will explore the intricacies of the transport layer in computer networks. I'm your instructor, Vishal Shrivastav, and I look forward to guiding you through this fascinating topic as we delve into the core concepts and protocols.

TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. TCP uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with applications using a byte stream rather than packets. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.

TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery through:
- Application multiplexing
- ACKs and retransmissions for reliability
- Flow and congestion control
It uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with a byte stream, not packets.
TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a connection between sender and receiver to maintain connection-specific state before sending data.

ACKs, or acknowledgements, are crucial for TCP's reliability. The receiver sends ACKs to confirm data received, allowing the sender to know what has arrived successfully and what needs to be retransmitted. ACKs provide feedback to ensure all data is delivered reliably, in the correct order, to the application.

The sequence and acknowledgement numbers in the TCP header are both 32 bits long. The sequence number identifies the byte number of the first byte of data, while the acknowledgement number confirms the last byte successfully received, requesting the next expected byte. These fields enable reliable, in-order data delivery.
