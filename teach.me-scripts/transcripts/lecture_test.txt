Welcome to ECE 46300, Transport Layer IV. In this course, we will dive into the intricacies of the transport layer, building upon the knowledge from previous courses. Our instructor for this semester is Vishal Shrivastav. Let's begin our exploration of this crucial layer in computer networking.

The Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable, in-order delivery to applications through features like application multiplexing, ACKs and retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control. TCP uses byte stream abstraction, communicating with applications using a byte stream rather than packets. It is connection-oriented, establishing a pairwise sender-receiver connection before sending data.

TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a connection before sending data and maintaining connection-specific state. It provides reliable, in-order delivery using byte stream abstraction rather than packets. TCP is the transport workhorse of the internet, enabling the delivery of application data between endpoints in an efficient and robust manner.

A TCP connection is identified by a 5-tuple of source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol. The connection setup exchanges an initial sequence number (ISN), randomly chosen by each endpoint, to mark the start of the byte stream. The ISN enables the receiver to order the incoming byte stream.

Random ISNs prevent port number reuse issues and TCP sequence prediction attacks. If a connection's ISN was always 0, an attacker could easily guess valid sequence numbers. Choosing ISNs randomly for each new connection mitigates these risks, enhancing TCP's reliability and security.
